    <tr>
      <td align="center">India Gate is one of the politically and historically significant places in Delhi. It is represented as an All India War Memorial as it displays its grandeur to honor the martyrdom of valor fore-taken by the India Army. It was constructed as a war memorial by the British Raj in order to pay tribute to the martyrdom of British Indian Army during the First World War. Within the premises of India Gate lies Amar Jawan Jyoti, that remains constantly flamed or lit up as a gesture of respect and honor to the martyrs. There is a huge parade that crosses India Gate on Republic Day to honor this tradition.</td>
