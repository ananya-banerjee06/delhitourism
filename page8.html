      <td align="center">Humayun's Tomb is a top Delhi attraction and one of the city's prominent Mughal-era monuments. It contains the body of the second emperor of the Mughal Dynasty, Emperor Humayun, who reigned in the 16th century. However, mysteriously, it wasn't completed until nearly 15 years after his death. Humayun's Tomb was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993. The grandiose monumental mausoleum, with its elaborate garden setting, was the first of its kind in India. It created a new style of Mughal architecture, which served as inspiration for later Mughal monuments.
